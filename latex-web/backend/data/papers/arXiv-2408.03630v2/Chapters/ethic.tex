The dataset we constructed is sourced from a publicly available model collection originated from the BPM Academic Initiative and does not contain any sensitive or personal privacy related information.
The procedural graphs used in our dataset are available for research purposes on the ``CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 DEED'' licence~\footnote{\url{http://fundamentals-of-bpm.org/process-model-collections/}}, which explicitly permits that we can not only use the collected examples but also ``remix, transform, and build upon the material''.
Therefore, we believe that there is no ethical issue with our work.
