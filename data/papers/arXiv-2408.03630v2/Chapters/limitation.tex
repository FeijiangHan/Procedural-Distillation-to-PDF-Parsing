The procedural documents in our dataset can hardly be equal to the documents directly written by experts. Despite this fact, we believe our dataset can still largely promote the study of automatic procedural graph extraction. The samples for few-shot learning are randomly selected from the dataset. This may lead to fluctuations in LLMs' results. However, since the samples of all LLMs are randomly chosen, we believe the experimental setup is fair. We acknowledge that carefully selecting samples would yield better results, but this is not the focus of this benchmark. We only design one prompt for all LLMs. Although using another elaborate prompt could introduce new variations to the experimental results, we consider this as a topic for future research.
