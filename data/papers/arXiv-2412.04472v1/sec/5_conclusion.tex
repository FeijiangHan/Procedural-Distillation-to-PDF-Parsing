\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \method, a novel stereo matching framework that leverages monocular depth VFMs to overcome traditional stereo matching limitations. Combining stereo geometric constraints with monocular priors, our approach demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization and robustness to challenging conditions like textureless regions, occlusions, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Furthermore, through our novel MonoTrap dataset, we showed that \method effectively combines the best of both worlds - maintaining stereo matching's geometric accuracy where monocular methods fail, while leveraging monocular priors to handle challenging stereo scenarios. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art networks in zero-shot settings validate these findings.
